1 Ans :-
 The default value of an array in Java depends on the data type:

For numeric data types (int, double, float, etc.), the default value is 0.
For boolean, the default value is false.
For char, the default value is '\u0000' (null character).
For object references (like String), the default value is null.

2 Ans :-
 Yes, you can pass a negative number as the size of an array in Java. However, it will result in a negative array size exception at runtime.

3 Ans :- Arrays in Java are stored in the heap memory of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

4 Ans :- Disadvantages of arrays in Java include:

Arrays have fixed sizes, so resizing requires creating a new array and copying elements.
Arrays can only store elements of the same data type.
Arrays do not provide built-in methods for common operations like adding or removing elements.

5 Ans :-
 An anonymous array in Java is an array without a name. It is typically created and used directly within a method or expression without assigning it to a variable. Here's an example:


// Anonymous array example
System.out.println("Sum of elements: " + Arrays.stream(new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}).sum());


6 Ans :- Different ways to traverse an array in Java include:

Using a for loop
Using an enhanced for loop (for-each loop)
Using Java Streams
Using iterator (for arrays of objects)

7 Ans :- The difference between length and length() method in Java:

length: This is a property of arrays that returns the length or size of the array.
length(): This is a method of the String class (not arrays) that returns the length of the string (number of characters).
